<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<br />Hi everyone!<br />
<p>I'm Zeynep Pekkan. I was born in 14th February of 1996. Now I'm 28 years old. I'm a Turkish girl and I'm from Istanbul. </p>

<p>I've been worked for Turkish Airlines for 5 and a half years. 
  I'm working there as a cabin crew but if i have to be honest, I'm not having fun or feeling great for playing this role at that company. 
  I want to be a web developer as soon as possible to start to use my brain. 
  Or I'm going to lose my mind due to the reasons of jet lag, lack of sleeping time, working under pressure and in pressurized environment.
  I'm working hard and trying my best to learn more and faster. 
  I hope that my target is going to be on point soon.</p>

<p>Beside these challenges, I love playing guitar and make music. If I can get an opportunity to have a job that i can work for a regular basis, I also want to play in a funk band. This would be pretty gorgeous for me. That's how I can get some seratonin actually :D. I hope that I'll suceed in this too.</p>
<p>I wish everyone a great life, success and happiness. Have a great day! </p>
