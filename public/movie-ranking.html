<h1>The Best Movies According To Zeynep</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>PATCH ADAMS</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. 
    This movie's main character is acted by my favourite actor Robin Williams. 
    It really made me cry so hard and made feel like a human being so that I feel something very special about this movie. 
    I also produced and shot a unique trailer as a finishing project for that movie when I was in college.<p>
    <h3>FOREST GUMP</h3>
    <p>I love this movie so much. Because who doesn't even<p>
    <br />-Life is like a box of chocolate.<br />
You can never know what you're gonna get.
    
        <h3>HEY ARNOLD!</h3>
        <p>It's not even a movie but a cartoon actually. 
        But it means a life for me.
        When I was a little kid, I was so into this cartoon 
        because it made me learn how to be a good person and provided the great taste of Jazz music. 
        If I have to confess, I was in love with that football headed boy just like Helga Pataki.<p>
